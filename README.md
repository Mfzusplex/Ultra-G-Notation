###Ultra-G Notation
Devised by the mathematician **Lucian Seaborgis** inspired by the **Steinhaus-Möser notation**, the **Ordinal Collapsing Function Hierarchy** and the** Fast Growing Hierarchy Functions.** The *Ultra-G* is an abbreviation for *Ultra-Geometric* --since its inspired on the **Steinhaus-Möser notation**.

### Definition
#### Episode I - Coaxis Function
using a **FGH function** and **Steinhaus-Möser notation** we define the *Coaxis Function* `c(n) = n-gon(fₙ(n))` for example `c(4) = square(f₄(4))` which is equal to `square(4↑↑↑4)` which is equal to `(4↑↑↑4)` inside `(4↑↑↑4)` triangles. this makes a *tower* of itself, and it is equal to `(4↑↑↑4)↑↑(4↑↑↑4)`.
At this point, the coaxis function remains computable while `n < Ωₘ`.

---

#### Episode II - Codimensional Function
Expanding the Coaxis Function with Buchholz's ordinal collapsing function and an **omega FGH function**: `d(n, υ, m) = ψυ(fΩ↑ₘ(c(n)))` 

> Buchholz's function is not a computable function, despite the fact that the associated ordinal notation is computable.

#### Episode III - Corporal Function
First extension of the *Codimensional Function* and last extension of the *Coaxis Function*. It is *ill-defined* -- but here is the definition:
 `Ωd(n, υ, m) = Z(ψυ(fΩ↑ₘ(c(n))))` * where z is a well-defined `d(n, υ, m)` of symbols set theory language function similar to **rayo's function** that is added to the *Codimensional function*, that outputs similarly to **rayo's function**. *
